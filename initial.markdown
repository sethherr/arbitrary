I stumbled upon [plover's blog](https://blog.plover.com/) from a [hacker news link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16379340) and ran into his `Content-type: text/shitpost` section. Instantly smitten, I could only read so many things before deciding that I needed to do something similar myself.

So here it is.

I have grand dreams of putting my [old tumblr](http://eatmoreoften.com/) here because I loved Eat(Food)MoreOften, and I really felt like I did a good job with posting there.
